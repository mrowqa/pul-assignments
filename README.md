This is my repo I used for FPGA class at my university. I have uploaded
the repository with an original code modifying only this README.

Most interesting parts:
- zad5 - sokoban. You need extra resources and I provided scripts to get them.
  Please note different textures preprocessing for different sokoban versions.
  Video is outputed via VGA and maps are uploaded to the FPGA via EPP.
- zad4 - gpu. Supports VGA 320x200 in black & white (limited by the available
  memory on the board). Video buffer is written via EPP.

Class resources can be found [here](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~mwk/pul/index.html)
(in Polish).
